                            I am a <i >Computer Science student</i> who discovered my durection by actually building things, writing code, 
                            breaking it, fixing it, and slowly understand how real systems logic work.
                            I'm interested in programming to solve real problems and create something genuine that helps people.

                            <br/>
                            My approach to learning is defined by <i>depth</i>. I prefer the discipline for <i>low-level programming</i>. I am willing to trade speed for the thorough learning required to write safe and efficient code.

                            My technical passion is <b><i>Embedded Systems</i></b>. I am most proficient in C and C++, specifically enjoying the challenges and beauty of memory management and hardware constraints.
                            While I have experience building full-stack web applications, I view them primarily as a way for me to understand the full data lifecycle from the sensor to the server.

                            Beyond the programming, my part-time job experience in high-pressure service environments taught me the lessons that classrooms cannot: 
                            humility, resilience, and the absolute necessity of reliability. 
                            I have learned to thrive under pressure, own my mistakes, and treat every challenge as an opportunity to sharpen my character.

                                    I love to move around, read philosophy books, and programming😁. 
                                    I do several sports (basketball, swimming, running, hiking, etc.)   
                                    I had joined a prestigious High School basketball competition (DBL) 
                                    and also completed a full 42.2 km marathon in Hsinchu, Taiwan. 
                                    In the future, I plan to participate in a triathlon when I'm free from the hustle and bustle of work👨🏽‍💻.

NEWEST 2:
About Me

I am a Computer Science student driven by the tangible impact of software engineering. 
While my journey began without a rigid compass, I found my direction in the process of building, debugging, and refining complex systems. 
I am not just looking to code, I am looking to solve problems that matter.

My approach to learning is defined by depth. I prefer the discipline for low-level programming. I am willing to trade speed for the thorough learning required to write safe and efficient code.
This mindset allows me to build robust skill and maintain focus in an industry that often chases the next trend.

My technical passion is Embedded Systems. I am most proficient in C and C++, specifically enjoying the challenges and beauty of memory management and hardware constraints.
While I have experience building full-stack web applications, I view them primarily as a way for me to understand the full data lifecycle—from the sensor to the server.

Beyond the screen, my part-time job experience in high-pressure service environments taught me the lessons that classrooms cannot: 
humility, resilience, and the absolute necessity of reliability. 
I have learned to thrive under pressure, own my mistakes, and treat every challenge as an opportunity to sharpen my character.

and lastly, I can say I am technically capable for what's coming in the future soon. Hope it helps you to know me a little,

IDEA: 
Revised (Strong, Specific, Human):

"My approach to learning is defined by depth. While many peers rush to the newest web frameworks, I prefer the discipline required for low-level programming. I am willing to trade speed for the thorough understanding required to write safe, efficient code.

My technical passion is Embedded Systems. I am most proficient in C and C++, specifically enjoying the challenges of memory management and hardware constraints. While I have experience building full-stack web applications, I view them primarily as a way to visualize and control the data generated by the devices I program."
