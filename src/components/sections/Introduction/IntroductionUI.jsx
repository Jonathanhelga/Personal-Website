                        <p>
                        I’m currently a 4th-year Bachelor’s student at Tamkang University in Taiwan, majoring in Computer Science and Information Engineering. I will graduate in June 2026.

                        I’m currently open to internship opportunities. My primary interests lie in C/C++ programming and embedded systems, and I’m excited to have the chance to work on hands-on projects.
                        <br/>
